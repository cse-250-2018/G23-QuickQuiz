# Motivation:
Due to covid19, many institutes started online classes and online exams. We wanted to create something which would be useful for the online exam. Then we extended this idea a bit and added many more features like quiz, forum, note sharing, etc.

# Features:
**Exam:**<br>
You can create an MCQ exam in the exam section or participate in exams previously created by someone else or see the results of other users. If you click on the marks obtained by a user on the results page of a specific exam, you will see the detailed result of that user. You must be logged in in order to create or participate in an exam.<br>
<br>**Notes:**<br>
You can share your notes as pdf files in this section and view or download someone else's public notes and sort notes from this section. Everyone will see your public notes, and your private notes will be only visible to you. You can rename, make public to private or vice versa, and change your notes' course name. You must be logged in in order to share your notes.<br>
<br>**Quiz:**<br> 
You can create or participate in quizzes in this section. Quizzes can be created by randomly picking questions from the database and adding new questions manually. If you click on the marks obtained by a user on the results page of a specific quiz, you will see the detailed result of that user. You also can participate in a random quiz by selecting the topic and number of questions. 
<br><br>**Forum:**<br>
You can write your blog posts, comment on them, and reply to others' comments here. You can also upvote or downvote blogs. You must be logged in to write a blog, comment on them, or vote for them.
<br><br>**Leaderboard:**</br>
You can see the overall leaderboard or leaderboard of a specific course. You also can sort the leaderboard by accuracy or user name.
